            I am constantly expanding my skill set and exploring new
            technologies to enhance my abilities as a front-end developer.
            Currently, I am diving deep into the realms of Next.js and

            technologies, database management, and server-side development. By
            honing my skills across the entire software development stack, I
            aspire to create seamless end-to-end solutions that encompass both
            front-end and back-end functionality.
